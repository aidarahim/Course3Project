# IndependentData.txt Codebook

This is the codebook for the IndependentData.txt data set. This data set was reduced from Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz et. al.'s Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset. The background related to the original data set is listed at the end of the Codebook.

This data set contains the average of each mean() and std() variable for each activity and each subject. There are 66 total measured variables.

Rows: With 30 subjects doing 6 activities each, this data set contains 180 rows of averaged data. 

Columns: 

Column 1: Subject Identifier [1-30]

Column 2: Activity [WALKING; WALKING_UPSTAIRS; WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS; SITTING; STANDING; LAYING]

Column 3 to 68: Various accelerometer mean() and std() variables. The variables are listed here

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

# For each record it is provided:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
